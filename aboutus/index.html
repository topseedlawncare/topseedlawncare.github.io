		<h1><p>About Us</p></h1>
		<center><h3><p class=info>Weekly Lawn Care:
Top Seed Lawn Care specializes in weekly lawn mowing for residential and commercial customers in Minot, ND. We know you have a busy life that should be spent with family and friends, let us help you! Let our weekly lawn care service help you take back that time.
		<br>
		<br>
The Process:
Weekly lawn maintenance service includes professionally mowing your turf and trimming around obstacles the mower cannot reach. Obstacles such as trees, edging of your sidewalks and driveway. When the mowing and trimming have been complete, we will remove grass clippings. Clippings that found their way into the street, landscaping or onto the driveway, patio and sidewalks will all be blown back into the turf.
		<br>
		<br>
Payment:
Payments can be made every week or every month. You can pre-pay as many months in advance as you would like as well.</p></h2></center>
